UPF DG Sizing Program by Analytic Method for a single load value


UPFDG.c is the main C file. (UPFDG - Unity power factor DG sizing)

In order the get the different test system output, we have to change the data in Offline.txt file

xx - 33 or 69 bus distribution system
zz - 96 or 5 load level (96 - from IEEE paper, 5-Approximate Load level)
Depends on the load level we have to change the hrs in main program

*********************************************
Where to change in Offline.txt file

busxx.dat / xx_aDG.dat		-- xx represent the bus data, a represents  DG number.
1Ybus.txt		-|
2Volt.txt		 | -- Intermediate steps to cross check or verify
3Jaco.txt		 |
4Inv.txt		-|
xxLagDGa.out		-- xx represent the bus data, a represent 1, 2 number of DGs
IEEERTS.dat/ LDData.dat		-- Select 96/5 (any one as load level)	
Price.dat			-- Price Details For every hour 
*********************************************

To run this program in linux

gcc -o anyname LF.c -lm
./anyname


To run this program in windows 

gcc -o anyname LF.c
anyname

Still have to find the price details of 5 load level
